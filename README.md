# operating-systems

One of my favorite topics in computer science and, in my opinion, one of the most important for a programmer.
Here are collected small programs and larger projects that are related to the study of operating systems.

## Contents:
*   [atomic_operations](atomic_operations) 

    **Increment** and **CAS-operation** _(compare and set)_ based on one of the RWM register implementation: LL/SC _(load-linked/store-conditional)_

*   [scheduler_round_robin](scheduler_round_robin) 
   
    Implementation of the **scheduler round-robin algorithm**. Uses the time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority

*   [slab_alloc](slab_alloc) 
   
    **Memory management mechanism**. The technique is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type.
